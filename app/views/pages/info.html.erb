<h4>The Process</h4>
	<div>
			<ol>
				<li>The client (Piggler) is in need of cash and places his/her location with an specific amount.</li>
				<li>Another user (Piggy) near by can see the order and can state how far away is from him</li>
				<li>When they meet, the Piggy hands in the cash to the Piggler and the payment method goes through the app. </li>
			</ol>
	</div>

<p>This web application was founded by Simon Acosta. The idea of aplication emerged in Ironhack Madrid, a web development bootcamp. We are currently in our beta phase and trying to incorporate every aspect that new Pigglers suggest us. Right now the application is present just in Madrid.</p>
