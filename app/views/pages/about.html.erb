		<p id="welcome"> About Us </p>
		<p>This web application was founded by Simon Acosta. The idea of aplication emerged in Ironhack Madrid, a web development bootcamp. He was helped by the Ironhack team, specially the Teacher Assistants, Alejandro Ugena and Alfonso Huescar. In the same way, all his mates in the web bootcamp encouraged Simon to never give up in his ideas and assisted him with the development of Piggler. We are currently in our beta phase and trying to incorporate every aspect that new Pigglers suggest us. Right now the application is present just in Madrid.</p>
