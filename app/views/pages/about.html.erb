	<h4>How The Idea Emerged?</h4>
	<p>The basic concept of the web application emerged when our founder was living in Madrid. During his days in that beautiful city, he used to went to the supermarket by himself. One day, when he was buying some food, a problem occured. He didn't have any money in his wallet and the supermarket didn't accept credit card. He left the food there, went to the nearest ATM and was not able to obtain money due to credit card regulations. Unfortunately he return to the supermaket and embarrased told the cashier that he was not able to pay the food. In that moment, he came up with the idea that people around him can be able to lend him money and he would pay them through his credit card. With that in mind, Mr. Acosta grab his computer and here you have the Piggler App.</p>

	<h4>Special Mentions</h4>

	<p>This web application took various days of hard work of not just Simon. He was helped by the Ironhack team, specially the Teacher Assistants, Alejandro Ugena and Alfonso Huescar. In the same way, all his mates in the web bootcamp encouraged Simon to never give up in his ideas and assisted him with the development of Piggler. As well, his professors during the bootcamp play an important role in the process of this application. Additionally, he obtained help from various tutors in the final weeks. Therefore, for all the support he received, he would like to mention them to show them gratitude.</p>
